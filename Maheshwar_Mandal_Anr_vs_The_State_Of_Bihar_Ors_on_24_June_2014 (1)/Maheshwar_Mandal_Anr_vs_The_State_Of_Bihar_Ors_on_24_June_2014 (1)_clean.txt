direction to the petitioners to handover possession of the disputed parcels of land to the plaintiff jashoda devi the respondent no herein the said order of the competent authority has been confirmed by the divisional commissioner purnea division purnea on th august in land dispute appeal no of therefore this petiton learned advocate mr yogendra mishra has appeared for the petitioners he has assailed the provisions contained in the act of he has submitted that the provisions contained in the act of divest the civil court of its function of adjudicating the question of title over the land the act of also confers unfettered and unbridled power upon the competent authority mr mishra has strenuously urged that the state legislature has no authority to confer power upon the executive to adjudicate civil disputes which is traditionally conferred upon the civil court under the code of civil procedure in support of his submission he has relied upon section of the code of civil procedure and a full bench judgment of this court in the matter of nand kumar rai others vs state of bihar others air patna the petition is contested by the state government learned advocate mr ram kishore singh has appeared for the state government he has relied upon entry of the state list of schedule vii to the constitution of india the bihar tenancy act and the judgment in the matter of smt basmati devi vs smt anju kumari pljr he however concedes that in the present case the competent authority has exceeded his jurisdiction in view of challenge to the constitutional validity of the act of we have heard learned principal additional advocate general mr lalit kishore on behalf of the state government mr lalit kishore has contested the challenge to the constitutional validity of the act of he has taken us through the various provisions of the act of he has submitted that the act empowers the competent authority to enforce the rights conferred by or accrued under the six enactments mentioned inmaheshwar mandal anr vs the state of bihar ors on june indian kanoon http indiankanoon org doc schedule i to the act of the power vested in the competent authority is therefore required to be read as confined to the enforcement of the rights conferred by or accrued under the aforesaid six enactments alone and if so read none of the provisions of the act of can be said to be unconstitutional mr lalit kishore has submitted that the petitioners have not challenged a particular provision s of the act of but the challenge is general and vague he has submitted that unless the state legislature lacks the legislative competence to make the enactment the enactment cannot be said to be unconstitutional he has further submitted that to challenge any provision as unconstitutional one has to establish contravention of the provisions contained in the constitution in the present case it is not the case of the petitioners that any of the provisions contained in the act of is unconstitutional in any manner mr lalit kishore has next submitted that the provisions contained in the act of are specific and unambiguous such provisions are required to be interpreted as they are the rule of construction of legal provisions does permit reference to the preamble of the enactment but no provision can be held to be ultra vires the preamble of the enactment mr lalit kishore has meticulously taken us through each provision particularly section and various clauses under sub section of section of the act of in support of his submissions mr lalit kishore has relied upon the judgments of the honble supreme court in the matters of m s burrakur coal co ltd vs the union of india and others air supreme court mohan lal vs kartar singh and others supp supreme court cases union of india vs elphinstone spinning and weaving co ltd and others supreme court cases and shiv kumar chadha vs municipal corporation of delhi and others supreme court cases in the matter of m s burrakur coal co ltd supra the very issue of interpretation of statute was the subject matter of consideration by the constitutional bench of the honble supreme court the honble court held it is one of the cardinal principles of construction that where the language of an act is clear the preamble must be disregarded though where the object or meaning of an enactment is not clear the preamble may be resorted to explain it we cannot therefore start with the preamble for construing the provisions of an act though we would be justified in resorting to it nay we will be required to do so if we find that the language used by parliament is ambiguous or is too general though in point of fact parliament intended that it should have a limited application in the matter of mohan lal supra a similar provision for summary enquiry by collector was the subject matter of challenge before the honble supreme court the honble court observed though the enquiry is summary it is judicial in nature therefore merely because the collector acting under section has to make a summary enquiry it cannot be said that he can decide only simple questions as regards the nature of possession and not those questions which are complicated but have a bearing on the nature of possession in the matter of union of india supra challenge was directed to the textile undertakings taking over of management act the court observed there is always a presumption that the legislature does not exceed its jurisdiction and the burden of establishing that the legislature hasmaheshwar mandal anr vs the state of bihar ors on june indian kanoon http indiankanoon org doc transgressed constitutional mandate such as those relating to fundamental rights is always on the person who challenges its vires the honble court further held the court must therefore adjudge the constitutionality of such legislation by the generality of its provisions and not by its crudities or inequities or by the possibilities of abuse of any of its provisions in the matter of shiv kumar chadha supra challenge was against the bar imposed upon the civil court to entertain matters under the delhi municipal corporation act learned advocate ms kumari ritambhara has appeared for the respondent no plaintiff she has supported the orders of the authorities below true the petitioners have not raised a specific challenge to a particular provision s the challenge to the constitutional validity of the act of is too general and vague the sole reliance is placed on the full bench judgment in the matter of nand kumar rai others supra mr yogendra mishra appearing for the petitioners has failed to establish that any of the provisions of the act of is unconstitutional nor it is the plea of mr mishra that the act of has been enacted by the state legislature without the legislative competency nevertheless i do feel that there are certain provisions in the act of which strictly speaking though are not unconstitutional do require reading down as the act of is under challenge before us we shall first examine the objects and reasons of the act of and its provisions the preamble of the act of reads as under whereas in the state of bihar disputes relating to record of rights boundaries entries in revenue records unlawful occupation of raiyati land and forcible dispossession of allottees and settlees of public land generate problems and cause unnecessary harassment to bona fide allotees settlees raiyats or occupants whereas such disputes with respect to raiyati land or public land allotted in favour of different classes of allottees are unnecessarily occupying major space of civil courts and hon ble high court and which should otherwise have been resolved by the revenue authorities who may be better equipped to deal with such disputes having regard to their continued presence in the field offices and their expertise in revenue administration whereas in larger public interest it is deemed necessary to provide for effective and speedy mechanism to resolve such disputes which give rise to major turbulence if not addressed immediately and effectively and whereas it has been found in analysis of data relating to nature of disputes that they mostly appertain to matters connected with the record of rights partition of jamabandi forcible dispossession of allottees raiyats boundary disputes etc and in this context the administration of the following acts is involved the bihar land reforms act the bihar tenancy act maheshwar mandal anr vs the state of bihar ors on june indian kanoon http indiankanoon org doc the bihar privileged persons homestead tenancy act the bihar bhoodan yagna act the bihar land reforms fixation of ceiling and acquisition of surplus land act the bihar consolidation of holdings and prevention of fragmentation act and whereas different forums and procedures have been provided for the resolution of disputes under the above referred acts and it is considered expedient to provide a uniform and common forum procedure and mechanism which would achieve the objective of effective efficacious and speedy resolution of disputes section of the act of defines various terms and phrases used in the act clause a defines competent authority shall be the deputy collector land reforms or any officer assigned to discharge the function and duties of the deputy collector land reforms in the sub division clause d defines land connotes government land raiyati land with structure if any clause e thereof defines allotted land or settled land connotes the

the bihar consolidation of holdings and prevention of fragmentation act section thereof provides for the jurisdiction of the competent authority sub section thereof empowers the competent authority

a raiyat which is not yet determined and is required to be determined in accordance with the provisions contained in any of the aforesaid six enactments sub sections to thereof read as under maheshwar mandal anr vs the state of bihar ors on june indian kanoon http indiankanoon org doc the competent authority shall not have jurisdiction to review or reopen any finally concluded and adjudicated proceeding under any of the act contained in schedule the competent authority shall exercise his authority for resolving the dispute brought before him on the basis of any final order passed by any of the authorities empowered to do so in the acts contained in schedule of this act the competent authority shall not have jurisdiction to adjudicate any fresh rights of allottee settlee or a raiyat which is not yet determined and is required to be determined in accordance with provisons contained in any of the acts contained in schedule provided that where rights of allottee settlee or raiyat are already determined under any of the acts contained in schedule the competent authority shall have jurisdiction to entertain cases appertaining to matters enumerated in sub section notwithstanding anything contained in sub section and hereinabove if no provision is made in any of the acts contained in schedule for determination of rights of allottee settlee or raiyat and claimed right is yet to be determined it shall be open to the competent authority to finally determine such right the competent authority wherever it appears to him that the case instituted before him involves complex question of adjudication of title he shall close the proceeding and leave it open to parties to seek remedies before the competent civil court section of the act confers certain powers of civil court upon the competent authority section of the act provides in all cases of civil nature concerning a land or a portion thereof and in which one of the parties to the case is an allottee or settlee under section of the act the state shall be a necessary party section of the act enjoins the competent authority to dispose of all cases summarily in accordance with the act and rules framed thereunder section of the act provides for expeditious resolution of disputes section of the act empowers the collector to exercise power of supervision and control over the competent authority section of the act enjoins the competent authority to execute its orders section of the act confers power interalia of attachment of the standing crop upon the competent authority it is apparent that the act of has been enacted with a laudable purpose of giving quick relief to the allottees and settlees who have earned a right or to whom a right has accrued under any of the aforesaid six enactments that is why section of the act of gives that act overriding effect over the procedure prescribed under any of the said six enactments thus in my view the scope and ambit of the act of is limited and is circumscribed to the extent of enforcement of rights conferred by or accrued under the aforesaid six enactments in other words it is an enactment for execution of the orders made under the above referred six enactments this intention is reinforced by sub section of section of the act of insofar as it expressly provides competentmaheshwar mandal anr vs the state of bihar ors on june indian kanoon http indiankanoon org doc authority shall exercise his authority for resolving the dispute brought before him on basis of any final order passed by any of the authorities empowered to do so under the acts contained in schedule of the act similarly sub section thereof expressly prohibits the competent authority from exercising its jurisdiction to adjudicate any fresh rights of allottee or settlee or a raiyat not yet determined under any of the aforesaid six enactments thus the legislative intent to confine the act of to execution of the orders made under the aforesaid six enactments is clear and unambiguous having thus circumscribed the powers of the competent authority under the act of the mischief has crept in in sub sections of section of the act of the said sub section of section of the act of enables the competent authority to determine the rights of allottees or settlees or raiyats which are not yet determined similarly sub section of section of the act of confers a discretionary power upon the competent authority either to adjudicate complex questions of title himself or to allow the parties to seek remedy before the civil court but for section of the act of the competent authority is not vested with power of adjudication under any of the other provisions of the act of the act which is designed to execute the orders made or to enforce the rights accrued under any of the aforesaid six enactments has been converted into a substantive or adjudicating enactment by section of the act of the power of adjudication conferred under the aforesaid sub sections of section of the act of are largely misused the power which is confined to the disputes in relation to the allottees or settlees or raiyats is exercised in respect of any dispute including the complex issues of title though there is no express bar against the jurisdiction of the civil court the said sub sections practically take away the jurisdiction of the civil court to entertain and adjudicate the disputes relating to the title to the land it is apparent that the act of has been enacted with an intention to give immediate relief to the allottees and the settlees whose rights are crystallized under any of the six enactments mentioned in schedule to the act of it is therefore necessary that any person approaching the competent authority under the act of must have a right settled or accrued to him or her under any of the aforesaid six enactments in other words the plaintiff has to be the allottee or a settlee of the land under any of the aforesaid six enactments and seeks enforcement of a right crystallized in favour of the plaintiff or accrued to the plaintiff under any of the aforesaid six enactments it is such a claim alone which can be entertained by the competent authority under the act of this opinion of mine is corroborated by section of the act which makes it mandatory that in all such cases the state government shall be a necessary party the preamble of the act is clear and discloses the intention of the legislature in enacting the act of it says disputes with respect to raiyati land or public land allotted in favour of different classes of allottees preamble of the act of further refers to disputes in relation to the record of rights partition of jamabandi forcible dispossession of allottees raiyats boundary disputes etc in context of the above referred six enactments section of the act of gives the overriding effect to the act of in respect of the procedure prescribed in the above referred six enactments this seemingly unfettered and unbridled power of adjudication has been misused by the competent authority to resolve disputes of title to the land which traditionally are required to be resolved by a civil court in the present case the respondent no the plaintiff asserted her right to land under a sale deed neither she is an allottee nor a settlee nor does the dispute arise from any right crystallized or accrued under any of the aforesaid six enactments the competent authority has clearly exceeded his jurisdiction andmaheshwar mandal anr vs the state of bihar ors on june indian kanoon http indiankanoon org doc has usurped the jurisdiction of the civil court incongruity in legislative drafting of sub sections of section of the act of is evident but then that is the way the legislature functions on one hand sub section of section of the act of expressly debars the competent authority from adjudicating any fresh rights of allottee settlee or a raiyat which is not determined or which is required to be determined in accordance with the provisions contained in any of the aforesaid six enactments on the other hand in stark contradiction sub section of section of the act of enables the competent authority to finally determine the rights of allottee settlee or raiyat not yet determined it is this sub section which is the mischief monger although it refers to the rights of allottee settlee or raiyat the broad language used by the legislature is largely misused to usurp the power not conferred by the act of and to determine the rights claimed by the persons other than allottee settlee or raiyat and the rights claimed outside any of the aforesaid six enactments this wide amplitude granted under sub section calls for intervention by this court and reading down of the sub section to bring it in consonance with the other provisions of the act of similarly sub section of section of the act of also is a mischief monger once jurisdiction of the competent authority is confined to the execution of the orders made or enforcement of rights accrued under any of the aforesaid six enactments sub section of section of the act of by necessary implication allows the competent authority to entertain matters not arising out of the aforesaid six enactments and issues invoking complex questions of adjudication of title the complex issues of title can never be decided in a summary proceeding envisaged by the act of the said sub section also has the tendency to convert the power of execution of orders into the power of adjudication the said sub section also requires to be read down to bring it in consonance with the other provisions contained in the act of a full bench of this court in the matter of nand kumar rai supra had the occasion to examine the constitutional validity of section of the bihar tenancy act as it stood after its amendment under the act of it appears that under the said amendment the legislature barred the jurisdiction of the civil court in respect of any application or suit concerning the preparation or publication of record or rights or settlement of rent or preparation of settlement rent roll or for alteration of any entry in any such record or for the determination of the incidents of any tenancy the said enactment was challenged on the ground that it was a fraud on the legislative power of the state and was enacted in colourable exercise of that power and that the impugned provisions were arbitrary the bench held that clause d of sub section and sub section of section of the act introduced by bihar act of were constitutionally invalid the said clause d of sub section and sub section of section of the act barred the jurisdiction of the civil court in the following terms d for declaration of title to or recovery of possession of or confirmation of possession over any holding or tenancy or part thereof in which correctness of any entry in any such record or roll is expressly or impliedly challenged or in which determination of incidents of any tenancy is involved maheshwar mandal anr vs the state of bihar ors on june indian kanoon http indiankanoon org doc suit for declaration of title to or recovery of possession of or confirmation of possession over any holding or tenancy or part thereof in which correctness of any entry in any record of rights or settlement rent roll is expressly or impliedly challenged or in which determination of incidents of any tenancy is involved may be instituted before the collector or any revenue officer specially empowered by the state government by notification in this behalf who shall dispose of the suit in the prescribed manner the bench held it is difficult to conceive how complicated title suits would be speedily and summarily disposed of by revenue courts and how the under raiyats would be benefited thereby i can take judicial notice of the fact that a large number of title suits have been filed throughout the state of bihar wherever revisional survey operations have taken place i am also aware that the number of civil courts is too small to dispose of such large number of title suits i am however also aware of the fact that the number of revenue courts is also not sufficient rather too small to dispose of such a large number of complicated title suits they will be simply unable to decide them unless they technically choose to literally dispose of the suits by any means no court by a judicial approach will be above to dispose of such a large number of suits i am however not concerned with the wisdom behind this legislation i am concerned merely with its constitutional validity in procedural matter suits of lighter vein have been allowed to be brought to the high court and complicated suits are to be finally disposed of by the revenue authorities i also do not see any justification for making a distinction between title suits for declaration of title and possession and suits of other types such a partition or mortgage suits in my opinion a similar mischief is found in the act of where the competent authority is allowed to entertain and summarily decide the rights which are not crystallized under any of the aforesaid six enactments and to entertain and decide complex issues of title to the land under sub sections of section of the act of the act of is clear and explicit insofar as its scope and ambit are concerned it is repeatedly emphasized that the act of has been enacted for enforcement of a right conferred by or accrued under the above referred six enactments it would not be out of place to note that all the above referred six enactments relate to land reforms and are pretty old the said acts are in force for more than fifty years most of the issues must have been settled by now it may be only residuary matters which may still require to be adjudicated enforced no claim to a property or a dispute relating to a property can be entertained or decided by the competent authority under the act of to resolve disputes other than the ones arising from the above referred six enactments in my opinion clause e of sub section of section of the act of which reads partition of land has to be read as the dispute relating to the land allotted or settled under any of the above referred six enactments and the claim made by an allottee a settlee or a raiyat the said clause e will not cover each and every issue relating to any land and the partition between the co sharers maheshwar mandal anr vs the state of bihar ors on june indian kanoon http indiankanoon org doc co parceners joint owners etc of such land similarly clause g of sub section of section of the act of which provides for declaration of the right of a person also requires to be read down again the right referred to in the said clause g has to be a right conferred by or accrued under any of the aforesaid six enactments and none other a person would mean an allottee a settlee of a land or a raiyat as defined in clause f of section of the act of no person other than an allottee a settlee or a raiyat can have an access to the remedy under the act of clause i of sub section of section of the act of which refers to construction of unauthorized structure should also be read down to mean the construction of unauthorized structure on the land of a raiyat allotted or settled under any of the above referred six enactments and no other land or structure clause j of sub section of section of the act of is clearly outside the purview of the any of the above referred six enactments the principle of lis pendence transfer is necessarily applicable to a civil litigation if at all its reference in the act of would necessarily mean the transfer of the land of a raiyat or a settlee allotted or settled under any of the aforesaid six enactments pending the adjudication under the concerned act in our opinion the power of the competent authority under the act of cannot be read to be wide enough to enfold in its embrace all kinds of disputes relating to any land in my opinion sub section of section of the act of brings a complete anachronism as it has the effect of encompassing in its folds any real or imaginary right an allottee or a settlee or a raiyat can claim which is not conferred by any of the aforesaid six enactments that would necessarily mean that the rights which are not conferred by or accrued under the above referred six enactments also can be adjudicated by the competent authority under the act of this wide power conferred upon the competent authority is unbridled unfettered and unguided as we have seen on the facts of the present case that they are grossly abused it is not possible to save the said sub section of section of the act of by employing the principle of harmonious interpretation the said sub section requires to be held to arbitrary and to that extent unconstitutional sub section of section of the act of empowers the competent authority to allow the parties to approach the civil court for adjudication of complex issues of title although the said sub section is directory should be read as mandatory it shall be the duty of the competent authority to refer the complex issues of adjudication of title to the concerned civil court having jurisdiction to entertain and adjudicate such disputes for the aforesaid reasons this petition is allowed clauses e g i and j of sub section of section of the act of are read down to the extent indicated hereinabove sub section of section of the act of is held to be arbitrary and ultra vires article of the constitution and unconstitutional to that extent the said sub section of section is therefore quashed sub section of section of the act of will be read as mandatory provision as indicated hereinabove the impugned order dated th december made by the competent authority cum deputy collector land reforms forbesganj in b l d r act case no of is quashed and set aside consequently the appellate order made on th august made by the divisional commissioner maheshwar mandal anr vs the state of bihar ors on june indian kanoon http indiankanoon org doc purnea in land dispute appeal no of stands quashed the b l d r act case no of filed before the competent authority cum deputy collector land reforms forbesganj is dismissed the respondent no will bear the costs throughout it is clarified that this order shall not preclude the respondent no the plaintiff from asserting her right to the disputed parcels of land before the civil court interlocutory application stands disposed of r m doshit cj as per ashwani kumar singh j i have had the privilege and advantage of perusing the judgment of honble the chief justice since honble the chief justice has extensively dealt with the facts and law involved in the matter i need not repeat the same i fully concur with the view of honble the chief justice with regard to sub sections and of section of the bihar land disputes resolution act for short the act of the honble chief justice has held that the act of is an enactment for execution of the orders made under the six enactments referred to in the preamble and schedule i of the act of she has further held that but for section of the act of the competent authority is not vested with the power of adjudication under any of the other provisions of the act of and the act which is designed to execute the orders made under the aforesaid six enactments converts the competent authority into an adjudicating court by dint of section of the act of i am in complete agreement with the aforesaid view of honble the chief justice i also agree with the view that sub section of section of the act mandatorily requires the competent authority to allow the parties to approach the civil court for adjudication of complex issues of title however i am unable to resist from adding some of my own observations in the context of the provisions of sub section of section of the act of sub section of section of the act of reads as follows the competent authority wherever it appears to him that the case instituted before him involves complex question of adjudication of title he shall close the proceeding and leave it open to parties to seek remedies before the competent civil court the group of words complex question of adjudication of title which form part of the sentence in sub section of section of the act of has been used as a phrase in the said provision while incorporating the aforesaid group of words as a phrase in sub section the legislature itself says that all cases involving issues of title per se involve complex questions and which cannot be decided in a summary proceeding being the ambit and scope of the act of and thus under all circumstances where issues relating to title arise would have to be mandatorily closed by the competent authority maheshwar mandal anr vs the state of bihar ors on june indian kanoon http indiankanoon org doc in other words the said phrase occurring in sub section of section of the act of envisages that no sooner than a question of adjudication of title which is inherently a complex one is involved the competent authority is required to invariably close the proceeding the word complex has not been used in contradistinction to the word simple in above view of the matter i am of the considered opinion that sub section of section of the act of strictly forbids the competent authority to entertain matters involving questions of adjudication of title i am of the view that the competent authority irrespective of nature of cases involving issues of title is bound to close the proceedings for want of jurisdiction and leave it open to the parties to seek remedies before the competent civil court in the result subject to the aforesaid observations of mine i fully agree with the findings and conclusions arrived at by honble the chief justice in the matter ashwani kumar singh j afr manish sanjeetmaheshwar mandal anr vs
