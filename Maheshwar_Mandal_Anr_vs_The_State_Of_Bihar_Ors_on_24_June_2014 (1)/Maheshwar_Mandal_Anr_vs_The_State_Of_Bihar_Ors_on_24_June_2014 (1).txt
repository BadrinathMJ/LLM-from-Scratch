SINGH C.A.V JUDGMENT (Per: HONOURABLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE)
12. 24.06.2014 This Petition under Article 226 of the Constitution has been filed by a father and the
son Maheshwar Mandal and Sanjay Mandal to challenge the order dated 27th December 2011 made
by the Competent Authority-cum-Deputy Collector Land Reforms, Forbesganj, Araria in B.L.D.R.
Act Case No. 91 of 2011-12 in exercise of power conferred by the Bihar Land Disputes Resolution
Act, 2009 (hereinafter referred to as "the Act of 2009"). The petitioners have also challenged the
constitutional validity of the Act of 2009.Maheshwar Mandal & Anr vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 24 June, 2014

One Jashoda Devi, the respondent no. 4, wife of one Gosai Mandal approached the Competent
Authority under the Act of 2009 for a declaration that she is the owner of the disputed parcels of
land (hereinafter referred to as "the suit land") and that she is entitled to the possession of the suit
land. She complained that the petitioners herein had forcibly dispossessed her. She, therefore, be
put in possession of the suit land. The case was contested by the writ petitioners. According to them,
the suit land was part of the lands inherited by the petitioner no. 1 and his brothers from their father
Bachchi Mandal. It was the ancestral property inherited from the original owner Babujan Mandal.
The sons of Bachchi Mandal were the joint owners of the land. The plaintiff, Jashoda Devi was the
wife of one of the brothers. She claimed title over the suit land through a sale purportedly made by
the late Bachchi Mandal on 22nd December 1995. According to the petitioners, the said sale was
later on cancelled on 29th February 1996. The land continued to be the joint property of the six
brothers and was partitioned amongst them on 12th April 2009 under a partition deed.
The Competent Authority-cum-Deputy Collector Land Reforms, Forbesganj (hereinafter referred to
as "the Competent Authority") held that the deed of cancellation of sale was not a valid document
and that the plaintiff, Jashoda Devi was the lawful owner of the suit land. In view of the said finding,
the Competent Authority issued direction to the petitioners to handover possession of the disputed
parcels of land to the plaintiff, Jashoda Devi, the respondent no. 4 herein. The said order of the
Competent Authority has been confirmed by the Divisional Commissioner, Purnea Division, Purnea
on 8th August 2012 in Land Dispute Appeal No. 69 of 2012. Therefore, this Petiton.
Learned advocate Mr. Yogendra Mishra has appeared for the petitioners. He has assailed the
provisions contained in the Act of 2009. He has submitted that the provisions contained in the Act
of 2009 divest the Civil Court of its function of adjudicating the question of title over the land. The
Act of 2009 also confers unfettered and unbridled power upon the Competent Authority. Mr. Mishra
has strenuously urged that the State legislature has no authority to confer power upon the executive
to adjudicate civil disputes which is traditionally conferred upon the Civil Court under the Code of
Civil Procedure. In support of his submission, he has relied upon Section 9 of the Code of Civil
Procedure and a Full Bench judgment of this Court in the matter of Nand Kumar Rai & Others Vs.
State of Bihar & Others [AIR 1974 Patna 164].
The Petition is contested by the State Government.
Learned advocate Mr. Ram Kishore Singh has appeared for the State Government. He has relied
upon Entry 18 of the State List of Schedule VII to the Constitution of India, the Bihar Tenancy Act,
1885 and the judgment in the matter of Smt. Basmati Devi Vs. Smt. Anju Kumari [2012 (3) PLJR
214]. He, however, concedes that in the present case the Competent Authority has exceeded his
jurisdiction.
In view of challenge to the constitutional validity of the Act of 2009, we have heard learned Principal
Additional Advocate General, Mr. Lalit Kishore on behalf of the State Government. Mr. Lalit Kishore
has contested the challenge to the constitutional validity of the Act of 2009. He has taken us through
the various provisions of the Act of 2009. He has submitted that the Act empowers the Competent
Authority to enforce the rights conferred by or accrued under the six enactments mentioned inMaheshwar Mandal & Anr vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 24 June, 2014
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/154031036/ 2
Schedule I to the Act of 2009. The power vested in the Competent Authority is, therefore, required
to be read as confined to the enforcement of the rights conferred by or accrued under the aforesaid
six enactments alone; and if so read, none of the provisions of the Act of 2009 can be said to be
unconstitutional. Mr. Lalit Kishore has submitted that the petitioners have not challenged a
particular provision/s of the Act of 2009, but the challenge is general and vague. He has submitted
that unless the State legislature lacks the legislative competence to make the enactment, the
enactment cannot be said to be unconstitutional. He has further submitted that to challenge any
provision as unconstitutional one has to establish contravention of the provisions contained in the
Constitution. In the present case it is not the case of the petitioners that any of the provisions
contained in the Act of 2009 is unconstitutional in any manner. Mr. Lalit Kishore has next
submitted that the provisions contained in the Act of 2009 are specific and unambiguous. Such
provisions are required to be interpreted as they are. The rule of construction of legal provisions
does permit reference to the preamble of the enactment, but no provision can be held to be ultra
vires the preamble of the enactment. Mr. Lalit Kishore has meticulously taken us through each
provision particularly Section 4 and various clauses under Sub-section (1) of Section 4 of the Act of
2009.
In support of his submissions, Mr. Lalit Kishore has relied upon the judgments of the Honble
Supreme Court in the matters of M/s Burrakur Coal Co. Ltd. Vs. The Union of India and Others
{AIR 1961 Supreme Court 954, Mohan Lal Vs. Kartar Singh and Others {1995 Supp (4) Supreme
Court Cases 684, Union of India Vs. Elphinstone Spinning and Weaving Co. Ltd. and Others
{(2001)4 Supreme Court Cases 139} and Shiv Kumar Chadha Vs. Municipal Corporation of Delhi
and Others {(1993) 3 Supreme Court Cases 161}.
In the matter of M.s Burrakur Coal Co. Ltd. (supra) the very issue of interpretation of statute was the
subject matter of consideration by the Constitutional Bench of the Honble Supreme Court. The
Honble Court held, "it is one of the cardinal principles of construction that where the language of
an Act is clear, the preamble must be disregarded though, where the object or meaning of an
enactment is not clear, the preamble may be resorted to explain it. ... We cannot, therefore, start
with the preamble for construing the provisions of an Act, though, we would be justified in resorting
to it, nay, we will be required to do so, if we find that the language used by Parliament is ambiguous
or is too general though in point of fact Parliament intended that it should have a limited
application."
In the matter of Mohan Lal (supra) a similar provision for summary enquiry by collector was the
subject matter of challenge before the Honble Supreme Court. The Honble Court observed,
"Though the enquiry is summary it is judicial in nature. .... Therefore, merely because the Collector
acting under section 43 has to make a summary enquiry, it cannot be said that he can decide only
simple questions as regards the nature of possession and not those questions which are complicated
but have a bearing on the nature of possession."
In the matter of Union of India (supra) challenge was directed to the Textile Undertakings (Taking
Over of Management) Act, 1983. The Court observed, "There is always a presumption that the
legislature does not exceed its jurisdiction and the burden of establishing that the legislature hasMaheshwar Mandal & Anr vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 24 June, 2014
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/154031036/ 3
transgressed constitutional mandate, such as those relating to fundamental rights is always on the
person who challenges its vires". The Honble Court further held, "The Court must therefore
adjudge the constitutionality of such legislation by the generality of its provisions and not by its
crudities or inequities or by the possibilities of abuse of any of its provisions."
In the matter of Shiv Kumar Chadha (supra) challenge was against the bar imposed upon the Civil
Court to entertain matters under the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957.
Learned advocate Ms. Kumari Ritambhara has appeared for the respondent no. 4-plaintiff. She has
supported the orders of the authorities below.
True, the petitioners have not raised a specific challenge to a particular provision/s. The challenge to
the constitutional validity of the Act of 2009 is too general and vague. The sole reliance is placed on
the Full Bench judgment in the matter of Nand Kumar Rai & Others (supra). Mr. Yogendra Mishra
appearing for the petitioners has failed to establish that any of the provisions of the Act of 2009 is
unconstitutional; nor it is the plea of Mr. Mishra that the Act of 2009 has been enacted by the State
legislature without the legislative competency. Nevertheless, I do feel that there are certain
provisions in the Act of 2009 which, strictly speaking though are not unconstitutional, do require
reading down.
As the Act of 2009 is under challenge before us, we shall first examine the objects and reasons of the
Act of 2009 and its provisions.
The preamble of the Act of 2009 reads as under :-
"WHEREAS, in the State of Bihar, disputes relating to record of rights, boundaries, entries in
revenue records, unlawful occupation of raiyati land and forcible dispossession of allottees and
settlees of public land, generate problems and cause unnecessary harassment to bona fide
allotees/settlees, raiyats or occupants;
WHEREAS, such disputes with respect to raiyati land or public land allotted in favour of different
classes of allottees are unnecessarily occupying major space of Civil Courts and Hon'ble High Court
and which should otherwise have been resolved by the Revenue Authorities, who may be better
equipped to deal with such disputes having regard to their continued presence in the field offices
and their expertise in Revenue Administration, WHEREAS, in larger public interest it is deemed
necessary to provide for effective and speedy mechanism to resolve such disputes which give rise to
major turbulence if not addressed immediately and effectively;
AND, WHEREAS, it has been found in analysis of data relating to nature of disputes that they
mostly appertain to matters connected with the Record of Rights, partition of jamabandi, forcible
dispossession of allottees/raiyats, boundary disputes etc. and in this context, the administration of
the following Acts is involved:
                  (1)     The Bihar Land Reforms Act, 1950,
                  (2)          The Bihar Tenancy Act, 1885,Maheshwar Mandal & Anr vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 24 June, 2014
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/154031036/ 4
                  (3)     The Bihar Privileged Persons Homestead Tenancy
                          Act, 1947,
                  (4)          The Bihar Bhoodan Yagna Act, 1954,
                  (5)      The Bihar Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling and
                          Acquisition of Surplus Land) Act, 1961,
(6) The Bihar Consolidation of Holdings and Prevention of Fragmentation Act, 1956, AND,
WHEREAS, different forums and procedures have been provided for the resolution of disputes
under the above referred Acts and it is considered expedient to provide a uniform and common
forum, procedure and mechanism which would achieve the objective of effective, efficacious and
speedy resolution of disputes."
Section 2 of the Act of 2009 defines various terms and phrases used in the Act. Clause (a) defines,
""Competent Authority" shall be the Deputy Collector Land Reforms or any officer assigned to
discharge the function and duties of the Deputy Collector Land Reforms in the Sub-division". Clause
(d) defines, ""Land" connotes Government land, raiyati land, with structure, if any". Clause (e)
thereof defines, ""Allotted Land or Settled Land" connotes the land which is allotted or settled or on
which raiyati rights have accrued under any of the Acts mentioned in Schedule-1 of this Act". Clause
(f) thereof defines, ""Allottee or Settlee" connotes the person with whom land has been settled by the
competent authority or the person who has acquired raiyati rights over the land, under any of the
Acts contained in Schedule-1 of this Act". Clause (g) thereof defines ""Raiyat" connotes a raiyat as
defined under the provision of the Bihar Tenancy Act, 1885". Section 3 of the Act of 2009 gives the
Act of 2009 overriding effect over the procedure prescribed under (i) The Bihar Land Reforms Act,
1950, (ii) The Bihar Tenancy Act, 1885, (iii) The Bihar Privileged Persons Homestead Tenancy Act,
1947, (iv) The Bihar Bhoodan Yagna Act, 1954, (v) The Bihar Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling and
Acquisition of Surplus Land) Act, 1961, (vi) The Bihar Consolidation of Holdings and Prevention of
Fragmentation Act, 1956. Section 4 thereof provides for the jurisdiction of the Competent Authority.
Sub-section (1) thereof empowers the Competent Authority, interalia, to resolve the disputes arising
out of
(a) Unauthorised and unlawful dispossession of any settlee or allottee from any land or part thereof,
settled with or allotted to him under any Act contained in Schedule-1 of this Act by issuance of any
settlement document/parcha by a Competent Authority; (b) Restoration of possession of settled/
allotted land in favour of legally entitled settlee/ allottee or his successors/heirs, upon adjudication
of unauthorized and unlawful dispossession; (c) Threatened dispossession of a legally entitled
settllee/allottee; (d) Any of the matters enumerated in
(a), (b) and (c) above appertaining of raiyati land; (e) Partition of land holding; (f) Correction of
entry made in the Record of Rights including map/survey map; (g) Declaration of the right of a
person; (h) Boundary disputes; (i) Construction of unauthorized structure; and (j) Lis pendens
transfer. Sub-section (3) thereof imposes specific bar upon the Competent Authority in respect of
the fresh rights of allottee/settlee or a raiyat which is not yet determined and is required to be
determined in accordance with the provisions contained in any of the aforesaid six enactments.
Sub-sections (2) to (5) thereof read as under :-Maheshwar Mandal & Anr vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 24 June, 2014
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/154031036/ 5
"(2) The Competent Authority shall not have jurisdiction to review or reopen any
finally concluded and adjudicated proceeding under any of the Act contained in
Schedule-1. The Competent Authority shall exercise his authority for resolving the
dispute brought before him on the basis of any final order passed by any of the
authorities empowered to do so in the Acts contained in Schedule-1 of this Act.
(3) The Competent Authority shall not have jurisdiction to adjudicate any fresh rights
of allottee/settlee or a raiyat which is not yet determined and is required to be
determined in accordance with provisons contained in any of the Acts contained in
Schedule-1:
Provided that where rights of allottee/settlee or raiyat are already determined under
any of the Acts contained in Schedule-1, the Competent Authority shall have
jurisdiction to entertain cases appertaining to matters enumerated in sub- section (1).
(4) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub- section (2) and (3) hereinabove, if no
provision is made in any of the Acts contained in Schedule-1 for determination of
rights of allottee/ settlee or raiyat and claimed right is yet to be determined, it shall
be open to the Competent Authority to finally determine such right.
(5) The Competent Authority, wherever it appears to him that the case instituted
before him involves complex question of adjudication of title, he shall close the
proceeding and leave it open to parties to seek remedies before the competent Civil
Court."
Section 5 of the Act confers certain powers of Civil Court upon the Competent
Authority. Section 6 of the Act provides, "in all cases of civil nature, concerning a land
or a portion thereof, and in which one of the parties to the case is an allottee or settlee
under Section-2 of the Act, the State shall be a necessary party". Section 7 of the Act
enjoins the Competent Authority to dispose of all cases summarily in accordance with
the Act and Rules framed thereunder. Section 9 of the Act provides for expeditious
resolution of disputes. Section 12 of the Act empowers the Collector to exercise power
of supervision and control over the Competent Authority. Section 15 of the Act
enjoins the Competent Authority to execute its orders. Section 16 of the Act confers
power, interalia, of attachment of the standing crop upon the Competent Authority.
It is apparent that the Act of 2009 has been enacted with a laudable purpose of giving quick relief to
the allottees and settlees who have earned a right or to whom a right has accrued under any of the
aforesaid six enactments. That is why Section 3 of the Act of 2009 gives that Act overriding effect
over the procedure prescribed under any of the said six enactments. Thus, in my view, the scope and
ambit of the Act of 2009 is limited and is circumscribed to the extent of enforcement of rights
conferred by or accrued under the aforesaid six enactments. In other words, it is an enactment for
execution of the orders made under the above referred six enactments. This intention is reinforced
by Sub-section(2) of Section 4 of the Act of 2009 insofar as it expressly provides, "CompetentMaheshwar Mandal & Anr vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 24 June, 2014
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/154031036/ 6
Authority shall exercise his authority for resolving the dispute brought before him on basis of any
final order passed by any of the authorities empowered to do so under the Acts contained in
Schedule-1 of the Act". Similarly, Sub-section (3) thereof expressly prohibits the Competent
Authority from exercising its jurisdiction to adjudicate any fresh rights of allottee or settlee or a
raiyat not yet determined under any of the aforesaid six enactments. Thus, the legislative intent to
confine the Act of 2009 to execution of the orders made under the aforesaid six enactments is clear
and unambiguous. Having thus circumscribed the powers of the Competent Authority under the Act
of 2009, the mischief has crept in in Sub-sections (4) & (5) of Section 4 of the Act of 2009. The said
Sub-section (4) of Section 4 of the Act of 2009 enables the Competent Authority to determine the
rights of allottees or settlees or raiyats which are not yet determined. Similarly, Sub-section (5) of
Section 4 of the Act of 2009 confers a discretionary power upon the Competent Authority either to
adjudicate complex questions of title himself or to allow the parties to seek remedy before the Civil
Court. But for Section 4(4) of the Act of 2009, the Competent Authority is not vested with power of
adjudication under any of the other provisions of the Act of 2009. The Act which is designed to
execute the orders made or to enforce the rights accrued under any of the aforesaid six enactments,
has been converted into a substantive or adjudicating enactment by Section 4(4) of the Act of 2009.
The power of adjudication conferred under the aforesaid Sub- sections (4) & (5) of Section 4 of the
Act of 2009 are largely misused. The power, which is confined to the disputes in relation to the
allottees or settlees or raiyats, is exercised in respect of any dispute including the complex issues of
title. Though there is no express bar against the jurisdiction of the Civil Court, the said sub- sections
practically take away the jurisdiction of the Civil Court to entertain and adjudicate the disputes
relating to the title to the land.
It is apparent that the Act of 2009 has been enacted with an intention to give immediate relief to the
allottees and the settlees whose rights are crystallized under any of the six enactments mentioned in
Schedule-1 to the Act of 2009. It is, therefore, necessary that any person approaching the Competent
Authority under the Act of 2009 must have a right settled or accrued to him or her under any of the
aforesaid six enactments. In other words, the plaintiff has to be the allottee or a settlee of the land
under any of the aforesaid six enactments and seeks enforcement of a right crystallized in favour of
the plaintiff or accrued to the plaintiff under any of the aforesaid six enactments. It is such a claim
alone which can be entertained by the Competent Authority under the Act of 2009. This opinion of
mine is corroborated by Section 6 of the Act which makes it mandatory that in all such cases the
State Government shall be a necessary party. The preamble of the Act is clear and discloses the
intention of the legislature in enacting the Act of 2009. It says, "disputes with respect to raiyati land
or public land allotted in favour of different classes of allottees...........". Preamble of the Act of 2009
further refers to disputes in relation to, "the Record of Rights, partition of jamabandi, forcible
dispossession of allottees/ raiyats, boundary disputes etc." In context of the above referred six
enactments, Section 3 of the Act of 2009 gives the overriding effect to the Act of 2009 in respect of
the procedure prescribed in the above referred six enactments This seemingly unfettered and
unbridled power of adjudication has been misused by the Competent Authority to resolve disputes
of title to the land which traditionally are required to be resolved by a Civil Court. In the present
case, the respondent no. 4, the plaintiff, asserted her right to land under a sale deed. Neither she is
an allottee nor a settlee nor does the dispute arise from any right crystallized or accrued under any
of the aforesaid six enactments. The Competent Authority has clearly exceeded his jurisdiction andMaheshwar Mandal & Anr vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 24 June, 2014
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/154031036/ 7
has usurped the jurisdiction of the Civil Court.
Incongruity in legislative drafting of sub-sections (3) & (4) of Section 4 of the Act of 2009 is evident.
But then, that is the way the legislature functions. On one hand Sub-section (3) of Section 4 of the
Act of 2009 expressly debars the Competent Authority from adjudicating any fresh rights of allottee,
settlee or a raiyat which is not determined or which is required to be determined in accordance with
the provisions contained in any of the aforesaid six enactments. On the other hand, in stark
contradiction, sub-section (4) of Section 4 of the Act of 2009 enables the Competent Authority to
finally determine the rights of allottee, settlee or raiyat not yet determined. It is this sub-section (4)
which is the mischief monger. Although it refers to the rights of allottee, settlee or raiyat, the broad
language used by the legislature is largely misused to usurp the power not conferred by the Act of
2009 and to determine the rights claimed by the persons other than allottee, settlee or raiyat and
the rights claimed outside any of the aforesaid six enactments. This wide amplitude granted under
sub- section (4) calls for intervention by this Court and reading down of the sub-section (4) to bring
it in consonance with the other provisions of the Act of 2009.
Similarly, sub-section (5) of Section 4 of the Act of 2009 also is a mischief monger. Once jurisdiction
of the Competent Authority is confined to the execution of the orders made or enforcement of rights
accrued under any of the aforesaid six enactments, sub-section (5) of Section 4 of the Act of 2009,
by necessary implication, allows the Competent Authority to entertain matters not arising out of the
aforesaid six enactments and issues invoking complex questions of adjudication of title. The
complex issues of title can never be decided in a summary proceeding envisaged by the Act of 2009.
The said sub-section (5) also has the tendency to convert the power of execution of orders into the
power of adjudication. The said sub-section (5) also requires to be read down to bring it in
consonance with the other provisions contained in the Act of 2009.
A Full Bench of this Court in the matter of Nand Kumar Rai (supra) had the occasion to examine the
constitutional validity of Section 109 of the Bihar Tenancy Act, 1885 as it stood after its amendment
under the Act 6 of 1970. It appears that under the said amendment the legislature barred the
jurisdiction of the Civil Court in respect of any application or suit concerning the preparation or
publication of record or rights or settlement of rent or preparation of Settlement Rent Roll or for
alteration of any entry in any such record or for the determination of the incidents of any tenancy.
The said enactment was challenged on the ground that it was a fraud on the legislative power of the
State and was enacted in colourable exercise of that power and that the impugned provisions were
arbitrary. The Bench held that clause (d) of sub-section (1) and sub-section (2) of Section 109 of the
Act introduced by Bihar Act 6 of 1970 were constitutionally invalid. The said clause (d) of sub-
section (1) and sub-section (2) of Section 109 of the Act barred the jurisdiction of the Civil Court in
the following terms :-
"(d) for declaration of title to or recovery of possession of or confirmation of
possession over any holding or tenancy or part thereof in which correctness of any
entry in any such record or roll is expressly or impliedly challenged or in which
determination of incidents of any tenancy is involved.Maheshwar Mandal & Anr vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 24 June, 2014
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/154031036/ 8
(2) Suit for declaration of title to or recovery of possession of or confirmation of
possession over any holding or tenancy or part thereof, in which correctness of any
entry in any record-of-rights or Settlement Rent roll is expressly or impliedly
challenged or in which determination of incidents of any tenancy is involved may be
instituted before the Collector or any Revenue Officer specially empowered by the
State Government by notification in this behalf who shall dispose of the suit in the
prescribed manner."
The Bench held, "It is difficult to conceive how complicated title suits would be
speedily and summarily disposed of by Revenue Courts and how the under-raiyats
would be benefited thereby. I can take judicial notice of the fact that a large number
of title suits have been filed throughout the State of Bihar wherever Revisional Survey
operations have taken place. I am also aware that the number of Civil Courts is too
small to dispose of such large number of title suits. I am, however, also aware of the
fact that the number of Revenue Courts is also not sufficient, rather too small to
dispose of such a large number of complicated title suits. They will be simply unable
to decide them unless they technically choose to literally dispose of the suits by any
means; no Court by a judicial approach will be above to dispose of such a large
number of suits. I am, however, not concerned with the wisdom behind this
legislation. I am concerned merely with its constitutional validity. In procedural
matter suits of lighter vein have been allowed to be brought to the High Court and
complicated suits are to be finally disposed of by the Revenue authorities. I also do
not see any justification for making a distinction between title suits for declaration of
title and possession and suits of other types such a partition or mortgage suits."
In my opinion, a similar mischief is found in the Act of 2009 where the competent
authority is allowed to entertain and summarily decide the rights which are not
crystallized under any of the aforesaid six enactments and to entertain and decide
complex issues of title to the land under sub-sections (4) & (5) of Section 4 of the Act
of 2009.
The Act of 2009 is clear and explicit insofar as its scope and ambit are concerned. It is repeatedly
emphasized that the Act of 2009 has been enacted for enforcement of a right conferred by or
accrued under the above referred six enactments. It would not be out of place to note that all the
above referred six enactments relate to land reforms and are pretty old. The said Acts are in force for
more than fifty years. Most of the issues must have been settled by now. It may be only residuary
matters which may still require to be adjudicated/enforced. No claim to a property or a dispute
relating to a property can be entertained or decided by the Competent Authority under the Act of
2009 to resolve disputes other than the ones arising from the above referred six enactments.
In my opinion, clause (e) of Sub-section (1) of Section 4 of the Act of 2009 which reads, "Partition of
land" has to be read as the dispute relating to the land allotted or settled under any of the above
referred six enactments and the claim made by an allottee/ a settlee or a Raiyat. The said clause (e)
will not cover each and every issue relating to any land and the partition between the co-sharers,Maheshwar Mandal & Anr vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 24 June, 2014

co-parceners, joint owners etc. of such land. Similarly, clause (g) of Sub-section (1) of Section 4 of
the Act of 2009 which provides for "Declaration of the right of a person" also requires to be read
down. Again the right referred to in the said clause (g) has to be a right conferred by or accrued
under any of the aforesaid six enactments and none other. „A person would mean an allottee/ a
settlee of a land or a Raiyat as defined in clause (f) of Section 2 of the Act of 2009. No person other
than an allottee/ a settlee or a Raiyat can have an access to the remedy under the Act of 2009.
Clause (i) of Sub-section (1) of Section 4 of the Act of 2009 which refers to "Construction of
unauthorized structure" should also be read down to mean the construction of unauthorized
structure on the land of a Raiyat allotted or settled under any of the above referred six enactments
and no other land or structure. Clause (j) of Sub- section (1) of Section 4 of the Act of 2009 is clearly
outside the purview of the any of the above referred six enactments. The principle of lis pendence
transfer is necessarily applicable to a civil litigation. If at all, its reference in the Act of 2009 would
necessarily mean the transfer of the land of a Raiyat or a settlee allotted or settled under any of the
aforesaid six enactments pending the adjudication under the concerned Act. In our opinion, the
power of the Competent Authority under the Act of 2009 cannot be read to be wide enough to enfold
in its embrace all kinds of disputes relating to any land.
In my opinion, Sub-section (4) of Section 4 of the Act of 2009 brings a complete anachronism as it
has the effect of encompassing in its folds any real or imaginary right an allottee or a settlee or a
Raiyat can claim which is not conferred by any of the aforesaid six enactments. That would
necessarily mean that the rights which are not conferred by or accrued under the above referred six
enactments also can be adjudicated by the Competent Authority under the Act of 2009. This wide
power conferred upon the Competent Authority is unbridled, unfettered and unguided. As we have
seen on the facts of the present case that they are grossly abused. It is not possible to save the said
Sub-section (4) of Section 4 of the Act of 2009 by employing the principle of harmonious
interpretation. The said Sub-section (4) requires to be held to arbitrary and to that extent
unconstitutional.
Sub-section (5) of Section 4 of the Act of 2009 empowers the Competent Authority to allow the
parties to approach the Civil Court for adjudication of complex issues of title. Although the said
Sub-section (5) is directory, should be read as mandatory. It shall be the duty of the Competent
Authority to refer the complex issues of adjudication of title to the concerned Civil Court having
jurisdiction to entertain and adjudicate such disputes.
For the aforesaid reasons, this Petition is allowed. Clauses (e), (g), (i) and (j) of Sub-section (1) of
Section 4 of the Act of 2009 are read down to the extent indicated hereinabove. Sub- section (4) of
Section 4 of the Act of 2009 is held to be arbitrary and ultra vires Article 14 of the Constitution and
unconstitutional to that extent. The said Sub-section (4) of Section 4 is, therefore, quashed.
Sub-section (5) of Section 4 of the Act of 2009 will be read as mandatory provision as indicated
hereinabove.

(R.M. Doshit, CJ) As per Ashwani Kumar Singh, J I have had the privilege and advantage of
perusing the judgment of Honble the Chief Justice. Since Honble the Chief Justice has extensively
dealt with the facts and law involved in the matter, I need not repeat the same.
I fully concur with the view of Honble the Chief Justice with regard to Sub-sections (1) and (4) of
Section 4 of The Bihar Land Disputes Resolution Act, 2009 (for short „the Act of 2009). The
Honble Chief Justice has held that the Act of 2009 is an enactment for execution of the orders
made under the six enactments referred to in the preamble and schedule-I of the Act of 2009. she
has further held that but for Section 4 of the Act of 2009, the Competent Authority is not vested with
the power of adjudication under any of the other provisions of the Act of 2009, and the Act which is
designed to execute the orders made under the aforesaid six enactments, converts the Competent
Authority into an adjudicating Court by dint of Section 4 of the Act of 2009. I am in complete
agreement with the aforesaid view of Honble the Chief Justice. I also agree with the view that
Sub-section (5) of Section 4 of the Act mandatorily requires the Competent Authority to allow the
parties to approach the Civil Court for adjudication of complex issues of title.
However, I am unable to resist from adding some of my own observations in the context of the
provisions of Sub-section (5) of Section 4 of the Act of 2009. Sub-section (5) of Section 4 of the Act
of 2009 reads as follows :
"(5) The Competent Authority, wherever it appears to him that the case instituted
before him involves complex question of adjudication of title, he shall close the
proceeding and leave it open to parties to seek remedies before the competent Civil
Court".
The group of words "complex question of adjudication of title" which form part of the
sentence in Sub-
section (5) of Section 4 of the Act of 2009 has been used as a phrase in the said provision. While
incorporating the aforesaid group of words as a phrase in Sub-section (5), the legislature itself says
that all cases involving issues of title per se involve complex questions and which cannot be decided
in a summary proceeding, being the ambit and scope of the Act of 2009, and thus under all
circumstances where issues relating to title arise would have to be mandatorily closed by the
Competent Authority.Maheshwar Mandal & Anr vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 24 June, 2014

In other words, the said phrase occurring in sub-section (5) of Section 4 of the Act of 2009 envisages
that no sooner than a question of adjudication of title which is inherently a complex one is involved,
the Competent Authority is required to invariably close the proceeding. The word „complex has not
been used in contradistinction to the word „simple.
In above view of the matter, I am of the considered opinion that Sub-section (5) of Section 4 of the
Act of 2009 strictly forbids the Competent Authority to entertain matters involving questions of
adjudication of title. I am of the view that the Competent Authority, irrespective of nature of cases
involving issues of title, is bound to close the proceedings for want of jurisdiction and leave it open
to the parties to seek remedies before the competent Civil Court.
In the result, subject to the aforesaid observations of mine, I fully agree with the findings and
conclusions arrived at by Honble the Chief Justice in the matter.
